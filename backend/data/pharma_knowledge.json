    "description": "The FDA drug approval process involves preclinical testing, followed by three phases of clinical trials. Phase I tests safety in 20-80 healthy volunteers. Phase II tests efficacy and side effects in 100-300 patients. Phase III confirms effectiveness in 1,000-3,000 patients. After successful trials, a New Drug Application (NDA) is submitted. FDA review typically takes 6-10 months for standard review, 6 months for priority review. Post-approval Phase IV studies monitor long-term effects.",
