## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| API rate limits/costs | High | Aggressive caching (24hr), tiered access, Redis layer |
| Inaccurate AI summaries | Critical | Human-in-loop validation for P0 entities, confidence thresholds |
| Competitor builds similar | Medium | Speed to market, proprietary pharma knowledge base (RAG) |
| Regulatory compliance | High | Legal review of data usage, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure |

---

## 8. Open Questions

1. Should we support international entities (EMA, PMDA) or focus on US-only at launch?
2. What's the pricing model: per-search, per-seat, enterprise only?
3. Do users need real-time alerts (e.g., "FDA just approved Drug X")?
4. How often should we refresh cached summaries (daily, weekly)?

---

## 9. Timeline & Milestones

- **Month 1:** Architecture adaptation, API integration, MVP agent development
- **Month 2:** RAG knowledge base build (FDA, ClinicalTrials), UI/UX design
- **Month 3:** Beta testing with 10 pilot users, accuracy validation, launch prep
- **Month 4:** Public launch, onboarding, feedback iteration

---

## 10. Appendix: Architecture Reuse Details

**Leverage Existing Codebase:**
- ✅ FastAPI backend with CORS and session tracking
- ✅ LangGraph multi-agent orchestration (parallel execution pattern)
- ✅ Tool-based architecture with graceful API fallbacks
- ✅ Vector RAG with OpenAI embeddings (adapt `local_guides.json` → `pharma_knowledge.json`)
- ✅ Arize observability for agent performance monitoring
- ✅ Async HTTP clients (httpx) for API calls

**New Development:**
- 🔨 Pharma-specific tools: `fda_approvals()`, `legislative_tracker()`, `clinical_trials_search()`
- 🔨 Entity resolution (map "Pfizer" to ticker, subsidiaries, alternative names)
- 🔨 Confidence scoring model for AI-generated insights
- 🔨 Export pipeline (PDF generation, PowerPoint template)
